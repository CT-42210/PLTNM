build the installer file containing: creation of profile directory, creation of settings, account, and profile list .txt files
build the launcher, that scans for setup.txt to read the line "setup completion = true." if the program finds the file setup.txt, it continues to attempt to read the file. if the program reads the variable correctly, the program continues to load. if it doesent say true, the file will ask wether to continue to install, or to re-install. if the program doesent find setup.txt at all, the program launches setup.py.
build the profile manager. this will create, delete, open, and use profiles. here, you can also make a new person
